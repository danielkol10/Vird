          <p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. </p>
          <p>Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing. </p>

          <p>After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. </p>
